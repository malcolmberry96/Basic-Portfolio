                <!--Need to float profile picture or paragraph in a way that is more appealing

                <p>     My name is Malcolm Berry and I am a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin 
                        with a bachelors degree in economics. My primary professional interest is web/software
                        development, but I hope to one day break into the fields of data science, machine learning,
                        and AI. My interest in development started my junior year at UT where I took an 
                        introduction to probability and statistics course taught by the Computer Science department. 
                        I fell in love with the course, but most importantly sparked an interest in Computer Science. 
                        As I interacted with students and professors within the computer science department, I began to 
                        seek out ways in which I could turn my fascination into a possible career. Over the next 
                        year in college I began to slowly learn more and more about the field of computer science 
                        and decided to put my efforts, upon graduation, into becoming a developer.
